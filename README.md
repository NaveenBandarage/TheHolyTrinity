# The Holy Trinity

The Holy Trinity of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH and DOGE). Given the markets love for BNB/BSC and eth's issues who knows if it will stay as part of the holy trinity. Essentially this was a project to help with my understanding of javascript and API usage. This site checks how much each of these currencies is going up or have been going up each roughly every day.
